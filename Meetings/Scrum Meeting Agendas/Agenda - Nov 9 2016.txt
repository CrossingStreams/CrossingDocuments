Information (Data) from each of the 6 steps will be extremely valuable for writing your individual report, demo, as well as 
Review the individual contribution report template contents
Review the final project report contents and updates.  (step9 below)
Sprint 2 retrospective exercise
What did we do well?
What did we learn?
What should we do differently next time?
What still puzzles us? 


Update User Story Map and Sprint 2 items.

	



Sprint 2 user stories  (*Changes if any from last week) with consideration from sprint 1 results (retrospective items)
Size estimations for sprint the user story ( should not be > 8 Story points)

	You should  have task break down and acceptance criteria done here.
	Complete each Sprint 2 user story with detail task break down, acceptance criteria, and test plan.  ( plan to complete this before starting the sprint 2)

	(completed Nov 3rd 2016)

Team members roles and responsibilities Adjustment (if any)

	No changes

Build / CI approach (script or manual steps) 

	Jenkins Build and CI
	(completed Nov 10th 2016)

Each User Story details (Task Break down, estimates, test plan, and owner)
Documentation (project reports and technical description) 
Team review results (Team);
How often does the team update each other with the status (tasks assigned) ?  
How will you handle conflicts (build, merge, coding, requirements…etc)
Do you have a common location to track and share your communications (NOT email or Skype…etc) and tasks to do.  Use JIRA to track your new tasks discovered as needed.
“Final” project report incremental update (TL and Team):
Identify who own which part in your team project report.
How does the team merge the overall work into one document?
BE sure this person understand the details of the project and attends all the project meetings and lab.
Architecture Layout (TL and Team) Updates
This should be included in your team final project report and updated incrementally. It is important to describe the reasons of chances with updated diagrams (UML) and flow of operation.
For individual report, use this diagram to identify your area of responsibilities and works.
